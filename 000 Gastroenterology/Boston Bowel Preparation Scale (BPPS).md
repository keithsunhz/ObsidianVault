# Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BPPS)

aka "bee bops"

Rates 3 sections of the colon
- Right
- Transverse
- Left

On a scale of 0-3
- 0 = unprepped colon segment, mucosa not seen due to solid stool that cannot be cleared
- 1 = portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment not well seen due to staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid
- 2 = minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool and/or opaque liquid, but mucosa of the colon segment seen well
- 3 = entire mucosa of colon segment seen well with no residual staining, small fragments of stool or opaque liquid.

Score of at least 2 per segment indicates adequate bowel preparation.
