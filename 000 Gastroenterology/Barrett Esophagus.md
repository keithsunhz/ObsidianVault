# Barrett Esophagus

## Diagnostic Criteria
2 Dx Criteria must be met
1. Document columnar epithelium extends proximal to the GE junction to line >= 1 cm of the distal esophagus
2. Biopsy specimens of the columnar epithelium must reveal specialized intestinal metaplasia with goblet cells that is characteristic of Barrett

## Endoscopic Examination
Columnar epithelium has a reddish color and coarse texture on endoscopic examination
Squamous epithelium has a pale/glossy/pearly appearance.

In order to document that columnar epithelium lines the esophagus, 2 landmarks are important to be identified
1. Squamocolumnar junction (SCJ)
2. Gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)

SCJ = visible zigzag line called the Z line

- Document important measurements
	- Diaphragmatic pinch
	- LES
	- Circumferential Extent of BE
	- Maximal Extent of BE
- Document hiatal hernia if any
- Biopsy protocol
	- obtain good quality biopsies and place each distance level in a separate container
		- non-dysplastic BE: 4 quadrant Bx q2cm
		- dysplastic BE (low/high grade): 4 quadrant Bx q1cm, consider using large Bx forceps

## Prague Classification
Report C/M
	where C = circumferential;
	and M = maximal extent
