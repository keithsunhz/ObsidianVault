# Hepatic Fibrosis and Cirrhosis

## Pathogenesis
Extracellular matrix (ECM) predominantly found in [[Space of Disse]]
During hepatic injury -> excess deposition of ECM
Primary effector cell involved in fibrosis is the [[Hepatic Stellate Cell]]


Hepatic fibrosis = accumulation of extrcellular matrix/scar in response to injury
Cirrhosis = end stage consequence of hepatic fibrosis
