# Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)

Established technique for management of colorectal lateral spreading lesions

Injectate contains
	inert dye indigo carmine
	1:100000 epi
	saline/colloid - colloid requires less repeat injection, shown to decrease procedural time

## Technique
- Performed under CO2 insufflation
- Perform [[Submucosal Injection-Lift]] - Introduce injectate to submucosa
- Stiff snares are used in EMR to facilitate tissue capture
	Include 2-3 mm healthy margin to minimize incomplete resection
	Downward pressure and aspirating gas to facilitate tissue capture by minimizing colorectal wall tension
Achieve tissue transection in 1-3 pulses of fractionated current
