# Gastrointestinal Tuberculosis

Isolated primary GI TB is uncommon. Approx 15-25% of GI TB cases have concomitant pulmonary TB.
Ileocecal TB is the most common (64%) location for GI TB, followed by jejunum and colon.

## Clinical Presentation
Most common Sx:
- abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, diarrhea, weight loss, constipation, bloating, sweating, hematochezia

Most common finding on abdominal exam:
- palpable RLQ mass

## Diagnosis
- Ileocolonoscopy with biopsies is the diagnostic procedure of choice for GI TB
	- Gross appearance can be divided into 3 categories
		- ulcerative lesions (60%) consisting of multiple superficial lesions confined mostly to epithelium
		- hypertrophic lesions (10%) - manifesting as scarring, fibrosis, heaped up mass lesions that can mimic carcinoma
		- ulcerohypertrophic lesions (30%) - mucosal ulcerations with healing and scar formation.
	- incompetent/patulous IC valve
	- Biospsies will reveal granulomas in 50-60%

- CT Findings
	- thickening of the ileocecal valve
	- asymmetric bowel wall thickening
	- massive lymphadenopathy with central necrosis. 
	- Cecum is contracted with disease on  both sides of the valve, and the valve itself often is distorted  and incompetent; 
	- Stierlin sign: Conification of the cecum, as seen on barium  enema or small bowel follow-through, is characteristic of TB  

### Differentiating GI TB from Crohn Disease
Crohn disease can present very similarly to GI TB
Features of potential help in differentiating
- inflammatory mass centered in the ileocecum; 
- transverse, circumferential ulcers rather than linear ulcers along the bowel axis (the latter is seen in Crohn disease)
- cecal valve incompetence with Stierlin sign
- large (>1 cm), hypodense (necrotizing/caseous) mesenteric lymph nodes
