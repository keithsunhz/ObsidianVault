# Integrated Relaxation Pressure (IRP)
 
 Measured via manometry
 
 [[The Chicago Classification of esophageal motility disorders, v3.0]]
	- median integrated relaxation (IRP) threshold of â‰¥15 mmHg on high-resolution manometry (HRM) performed in a supine position is indicative of failed deglutitive LES relaxation. 
		- In [[Achalasia]] and [[EsophagoGastroJunction outflow obstruction (EGJOO)]], the IRP is elevated
			- in achalasia there is failed peristalsis or absence of normal peristalsis
			- in EGJOO, there is normal peristalsis
