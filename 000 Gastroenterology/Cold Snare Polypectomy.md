# Cold Snare Polypectomy

## Mechanism of Action
Achieved by sheering mechanical force during snare closure

## Indication
Diminutive polyps <=5mm
Small polyps (6-9 mm)
For large polyps >= 20mm, piecemeal CSP 

## Technique
Place snare over lesion
Include healthy rim (2-3 mm) of normal tissue (to minimize incomplete resection) 
Tissue capture can be optimized by
	firm downward pressure
	aspirating luminal gas to reduce lesion footprint on muscoal surface
Once tissue capture is confirmed, snare is close to perform tissue transection
If unsuccessful, gentle traction against tip of colonoscope can be performed to facilitate transection
If still unsuccessful, snare placement should be revised
After tissue transection is achieved, irrigate resection defect for inspection
		oozing is expected and does not require treatment
