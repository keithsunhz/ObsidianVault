# Colorectal Polyps

## Types
2 major groups
- mucosal polyps
	- conventional adenoma
	- serrated polyp - sawtooth/serrated appearance microscopically
		- hyperplastic polyp
		- sessile serrated polyp
		- traditional serrated polyp
	- hamartomatous polyp
	- misc polyps
		- inflammatory/pseudopolyp
		- cap polyp
		- prolapse
- submucosal polyps


## Surface Pattern Classification
Crucial for large colorectal [[Laterally Spreading Tumors (LSTs)]]

Classifications systems include
- Kudo Pit Pattern
- Narrow‚ÄêBand Imaging (NBI)  International Colorectal Endoscopic (NICE) classification 
- Japan NBI Expert Team (JNET) classification

General rule of thumbs is that:
- Benign lesions demonstrate homogenous surface pattern
- [[Colorectal Submucosal Invasive Carcinoma]] demonstrate a demarcated area with surface pattern disruption within an otherwise benign homogenous surface pattern


## Resection Techniques
- [[Cold Forceps Polypectomy]]
- [[Cold Snare Polypectomy]]
- [[Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)]]
- [[Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD)]]
- [[Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR)]]

## Management based on Polyp Size
### <= 5mm -> Dimunitive polyps 
- [[Cold Forceps Polypectomy]] recommended if <= 3mm
- [[Cold Snare Polypectomy]] preferred

### 6-9 mm -> Small polyps 
- [[Cold Snare Polypectomy]] is the suggested modality

### 10 - 19 mm -> Medium-sized polyp
- [[Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)]]
- Piecemeal [[Cold Snare Polypectomy]] - not usually recommended

### >= 20mm => Large polyps
- Piecemeal [[Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)]] - enbloc EMR is not recommended given risk of [[Deep Mural Injury]]
- [[Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD)]]
- [[Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR)]]
- Surgery

## Specific Situations
### Lesions involving IC valve
If ileum is involved, resection begins within the ileum
after successful resection of ileal portion, sequential removal of remainig polypoid tissue should be performed: anterior angle -> posterior angle -> inferior lip -> superior lip.
Repositioning to R lateral can help with lesion exposure

### Lesions involving the Appendiceal Orifice (AO)
If distal margin within the AO cannot be visualized
	[[Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)]] is discouraged
	Consider [[Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR)]] or surgery	
If lesions is amenable to [[Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)]]
	Being by resecting cecal component
	Small volume submucosal injections should be done in AO to avoid impairing visualization within the AO
	Small snare should be used given thin cecal wall

### Lesions involving the Ano-Rectal Junction (ARJ)
- Performing [[Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)]] in the [[Anal Transition Zone]] requires technical modifications:
	- Abx PPx: 
		- [[Columns of Morgagni]] drains directly into systemic circulation and is a potential source of bacteremia with repeated submucosal injections
		- RocFlagyl routinely used.
	- Lesion access: 
		- gastroscope with [[Distal Cap]] attachment can be used
	- Pain management
		- mucosal resction frequently crosses dentate line, involving somatically innervated squamous epithelium
		- long acting local anesthetic can be given (e.g. Ropivacaine 0.5%), added to injectate. Requires cardiac monitoring
		- PO acetaminophen PRN on discharge
- Refer to colorectal surgeons for Transanal Endoscopic Surgery
	- Transanal excision
	- Transanal endoscopic microsurgery
	- Transanal minimally invasive surgery

### Non-lifing lesions
- Can be due to submucosal fibrosis 2/2 prior biopsy, prior endoscopic resection, tattoo injection, lesion biology or submucosal invasion.
- Cold-forceps avulsion with adjuvant snare-tip soft coagulation (CAST)

### Circumferential lesions
- Can be removed by [[Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR)]]
- high frequency of recurrence
- Iatrogenic strictures is a complication
	-  for distal lesions after resection, steroid enemas (20mg prednisolone sodium phosphate bid x 8 weeks) can be tried to minimize stricture formation.
	- endoscopic evaluation at 3 weeks post-resection is recommended to assess for for stricture formation

### Pedunculated lesions
- Large pedunculated polyps have increased vascular supply within the stalk.
- Consider to pre-treat stalk to minimzie risk of post-polypectomy bleeding especially if pedunculated polyps >= 20 mm (or stalk >= 10 mm)
	- Mechanical - endoloop or clips
	- Pharmacological - dilute epinephrine

### Sessile Serrated Polyps
- 30% if CRC, specifically proximal interval CAs are attributed to SSPs
- Workgroup Serrated Polyps and Polyposis (WASP) classification
	- Presence fo 2 features is diagnostic of SSP
		- clouded surface
		- indistinctive border
		- irregular shape
		- dark spots inside crypts
