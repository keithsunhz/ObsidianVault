# Submucosal Injection-Lift

## Advantages
helps delineate lesion margin
defines extent of the submucosal cushion
minimizes risk of deep mucosal injury

## Troubleshooting
Suboptimal injection outcomes include
	intramucosal injection - superficial bleb without lesion elevation
	extramural injection - lack of mucosal elevation despite injection
	jet sign - 2/2 submucosal fibrosis, a high pressure "jet" exits lesion during injection
	canyon sign - perilesion elevation without central elevation, result of submucosal fibrosis
