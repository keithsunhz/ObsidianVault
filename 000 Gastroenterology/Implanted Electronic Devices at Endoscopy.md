# Implanted Electronic Devices at Endoscopy

## Implanted Electronic Devices
### Cardiac Devices
Generally 2 types of cardiac devices
- Conventional Pacemaker
- Implantable Cardiac Defibrillator (ICD), some of which has pacing capabilities as well

### Non-cardiac devices
Other devices include implanted infusion pumps, neurostimulatory devices (DBS, gastric electrical stimulation system, peripheral nerve, spinal cord stims, urinary bladder, cochlear)

## Electromagnetic Inteference
### Definition of Electromagnetic Inteference
- Electromagnetic interference refers to effect of an electromagnetic field on the function of any electronic device
	- has 2 forms
		- conducted - electromagnetic source comes in direct contact with the body (e.g. electrocautery)
		- radiated  - body is placed in an electromagnetic field (e.g. MRI)

### Consequences of Electromagnetic Inteference
Concerning consequences of electromagnetic interference would include:
- inhibition of needed antibradycardia pacing in a pacing dependent environment
- delivery of inappropriate shocks or cardioversions by an ICD
- direct damage to the device, altering its ability to deliver pacing and shocks

### Factors associated with Likelihood of Electromagnetic Inteference
#### Factors associated with Endoscopic Electrocautery Device
- Intensity of the generated electromagnetic field
- frequency and waveform of the signal
- distance between the electrocautery application and the leads of the implanted device
- orientation of the leads to the EMF

#### Factors associated with Implanted Device
- presence and the number of leads
- distance between the anode and cathode of the implanted device
- programmed sensitivity of device
	- devices with bipolar sensing less likely to experience electromagnetic inteference

## Electrocautery use during GI endoscopy
Involves application of radiofrequency current in unipolar or bipolar/multipolar fashion
Resistance to flow of the current -> generation of heat -> electrocoag/cutting effect

### Mono/Unipolar Cautery
Current flows from active electrode of the electrosurgical device, through the patient to a distant return electrode (ground pad), and back to the generator

Uses
- polypectomy
- endoscopic sphincterotomy
- hot biopsy
- APC - for control of hemorrhage or ablation of mucosal lesions

### Bipolar/Multipolar Cautery
Current flows from 1 or more electrodes of the electrosurgical device through immediate adjacent tissue and returns to 1 or more electrodes on the same instrument.

Uses
- "bicap" probes for control of hemorrhage or other vascular lesions

#### Likelihood of Electromagnetic Inteference with Bi/Multipolar Cautery
Bipolar/Multipolar devices induce only a limited flow of current beyond the site of application -> located electromagnetic field is generated. Less likelihood of electromagnetic inteference.

## Management of Cardiac Devices
### Pre-procedural Planning
- Obtain info on cardiac device make, model, type, indication for device, degree of pacemaker dependence, patient's underlying heart rhythm
	- Cardiology will be able to provide recs on how the device will respond to magnet and advice whether the patient's device should be re-programmed during the procedure
- Device interrogation immediately before the procedure if possible
	- these patients are usually followed at device clinics q3-6 months

According to Heart Rhythm Society Guidelines, interrogation prior to scheduled surgery is recommended
- Within 6 months for an ICD
- Within 12 months for a conventional PM
- Within 3-6 months for any cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device

#### Pacemakers
- Non-pacemaker dependent patients can undergo routine use of electrocautery within alterations in management
- In pacemaker dependent patients undergoing endoscopy with prolonged electrocautery (especially unipolar) may require magnet application or permanent reprogramming to asynchronous mode
	- magnet held/taped in the proper position over a pacemaker generator will result in asynchronous pacining at a constant pre-specified rate

#### ICDs
- Consultation with cardiologist or a EP specialist advised
- ICD interrogation and reprogramming advised
- magnet placed over ICD will suspend tachycardia detection and/or ICD therapies

#### Patients with ICDs who are also pacemaker dependent
- Consultation with a cardiologist or EP specialist advised
- magnets do not affect the pacing function of most ICDs, unlike the pacemaker-only devices

### During the Procedure
- continuous telemetry and pulse ox monitoring
- ensure appropriate equipment for resuscitation, cardioversion, defibrillation immediately available
- Consider use of endoscopic devices with limited or low electromagnetic field generation
	- noncautery thermal probes
	- bipolar/multipolar probes
- Place grounding pad a good distance from the pulse generator and leads
	- ensure implanted device not between cautery source and grounding pad
- avoid use of cautery near implanted device (some advise avoiding therapy within 15 cm)
- Use lowest effective power output and briefest application

### Post-Procedure
- Remove magnet
- If device was reprogrammed, to ensure patient's device is restored back to prior settings

## Management of Non-Cardiac Devices
#### General Precautions
- Consider use of endoscopic devices with limited or low electromagnetic field generation
	- noncautery thermal probes
	- bipolar/multipolar probes
- Place grounding pad a good distance from the pulse generator and leads
	- ensure implanted device not between cautery source and grounding pad
- avoid use of cautery near implanted device (some advise avoiding therapy within 15 cm)
- Use lowest effective power output and briefest application

#### Neurostimulatory Devices
- For patients with deep brain stimulators or gastric electrical stimulation, consult primary device specialist before considering inactivation of device output

#### Spinal cord/Peripheral neurological simulation devices
- have the patient zero the voltage output and then turn off the device before the use of electrocautery
