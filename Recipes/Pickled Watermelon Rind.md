# Pickled Watermelon Rind

Ingredients
• 5 lbs (2.25 kg) Korean melons / rinds
• 2 whole star anise  
• 2 slices fresh ginger (approximately 2 tablespoons)  
• 1 cinnamon stick  
• 1 tablespoon gochugaru
• 4 jujubes
• 3 cups white vinegar  
• 2 cups water  
• 3 cups sugar

Peel and cut the watermelon rinds. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Allow the pot to boil for 5 minutes then remove from heat. Add the rinds and jujubes, cover the pot and let stand.  
  
After 1-2 hours remove the lid, bring the pot to a boil and then simmer (just below a boil) for 45-60 minutes or until the melon cubes are somewhat translucent around the edges. Remove the pot from the heat once again and allow the melon and liquid to come to room temperature. Transfer to a lidded container and refrigerate. Once chilled the pickled rind is good to eat though flavor improves after a few days.
