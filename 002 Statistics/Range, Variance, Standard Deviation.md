# Range, Variance, Standard Deviation

Range = maximum value of data - mininum value of data

Interquartile Range (IQR) = 3rd quartile - 1st quartile     
	not affected by outliers given that it gives range of middle 50% of data

** all these are not calculated by hand IRL
Variance = average square variance
Standard deviation = square root of variance

In a Normal Distribution,
within 1 SD
- 68% of observations lie

within 2 SD
- 95% of observations lie

within 3 SD
- 99.7% of observations lie

===

Standard Error (SE) of sample mean = sigma/sqrt(n);
where sigma is the standard deviation of the population
