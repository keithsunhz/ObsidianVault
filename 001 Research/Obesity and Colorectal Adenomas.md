## Background
- multiple epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between obesity and increased risk of CRC
	- mechanism
		- subclinical inflammatory state -> increased TNF, IL6, CRP, adipokines -> insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, elevated IGF-1
- Link between obesity and colorectal adenoma is less clear

## Current Literature
- Polyp Prevention Trial
	- assessed BMI changes over 4 year period in 1826 pts with at least on conventional adenoma
		- neither weight gain/loss affected adenoma recurrence
		- weight loss alone did not appear to be effective for reducing adenoma recurrence
- Retrospective study of 779 average risk patients undergoing screening colonoscopy
	- BMI not associated with risk of adenoma
	-  no evidence of a trend with increasing BMI
- Meta-analysis of 36 published studies -> 5 unit increase in BMI is associated with 19% increased risk of colorectal adenoma
- Systematic review of 23 studies found that BMI > 25 had significantly higher prevalence of colorectal adenomas
